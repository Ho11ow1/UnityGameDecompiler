<br/>
A comprehensive `work in progress` decompilation tool for Unity games, providing extraction and reconstruction of game assets and code. 
<br/><br/>

## Overview

UnityDecompiler extracts and rebuilds Unity game projects by decompiling code (IL2CPP/Mono) and extracting assets (models, textures, scenes, etc.). It's designed to provide a streamlined workflow for game analysis, modding, and learning purposes.

The tool bridges the gap between compiled Unity games and editable projects, allowing you to:
- Decompile game code from both IL2CPP and Mono builds
- Extract and convert game assets
- Analyze code structure and dependencies
- Generate workable Unity projects from decompiled games

## Project Status

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: This project is currently in super-early alpha development. Features are being actively implemented and the project may change significantly between versions.

Current Development Phase:
- [x] Core architecture design
- [x] UI framework transition to Electron
- [ ] Basic decompiler implementation
- [ ] Asset extraction pipeline
- [ ] Project generation module
- [ ] Comprehensive testing with various Unity versions
- [ ] First beta release


## Key Features

- **Multi-format Decompilation**: Support for both Mono and IL2CPP compilation methods
- **Comprehensive Asset Extraction**: Extract textures, models, audio, scenes, and more
- **Unity Project Generation**: Reconstruct a working Unity project from decompiled assets
- **Modern Electron UI**: User-friendly interface for all decompilation tasks
- **Pipeline Architecture**: Modular and extensible extraction process
